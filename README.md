# webcrawler-v1
Experimenting with web crawlers and just familiarising myself with web scraping tools. The goal of this web crawler is to store all units of study offered in relevant sessions.

Aiming to:
  Create web crawler for UNSW units
  Brainstorm ways to store units outside of arrays
  Look into Scrapy module
